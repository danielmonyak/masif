## MaSIF- Molecular surface interaction fingerprints. Geometric deep learning to decipher patterns in molecular surfaces.

## Dependencies 
MaSIF has a long list of dependencies, as it relies on external software/libraries to  work with protein databank files and surface files, and to compute features and coordinates: 
* [reduce](http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/software/reduce.php) 
* [MSMS](http://mgltools.scripps.edu/packages/MSMS/)
* [biopython](https://github.com/biopython/biopython)
* [pyflann](https://github.com/primetang/pyflann)
* PDB2PQR, multivalue, and [APBS](http://www.poissonboltzmann.org/)
* [open3D](https://github.com/IntelVCL/Open3D)
* [matlab](https://ch.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) 
* [Pymol](https://pymol.org/2/) (optional)
