  # For the first of the two proteins, write a list of the residues that are to be blocked: those that are not in the target site. The target
  # site, which would be the 'center of the interface'  is the patch with the highest shape complementarity to the target. 
#  utils/compute_blocked_res_list.py 

  # Now run ZDock's create.pl to actually block these residues.
