Contains most the files that define the neural network, files to train and evaluate the neural network
and files necessary to extract files for the neural network.

The neural networks models for each application are defined in: 
- MaSIF-ligand neural network: MaSIF_ligand.py 
- MaSIF-site neural network: MaSIF_site.py 
- MaSIF-search neural network: MaSIF_ppi_search.py
