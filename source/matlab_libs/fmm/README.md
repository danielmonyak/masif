# source/matlab_libs/fmm/

Contains code for the fast marching method (to approximate geodesic distances much better than Dijkstra). 
Since it is much slower than Dijkstra, this code is currently only used to compute shape complementarity 
patches, and will be removed in the near future from MaSIF.
