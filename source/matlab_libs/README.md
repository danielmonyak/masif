### source/matlab_libs

Matlab functions to compute shape index values and coordinates. These functions will be removed in the near future.

+ compute_matlab_matrix.m: Compute matlab matrices based on the surface input files, compute the shape index (geometric feature) on each vertex, and in the case of MaSIF-search, compute the shape complementarity between patches. 

+ coords_mds.m: Compute the geodesic polar coordinate system: the radial and angular coordinates.
