These PDB files were renamed from their original PDB id to the PDB id of the complex structure. The chain ids were also altered to those of the complex structure. 

The list of PDBs was taken from:

Vreven, T. et al. Updates to the Integrated Protein–Protein Interaction 
Benchmarks: Docking Benchmark Version 5 and Affinity Benchmark Version 2. 
Journal of Molecular Biology 427, 3031–3041 (2015).
